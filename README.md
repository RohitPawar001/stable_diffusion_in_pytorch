# Stable Diffusion in PyTorch

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model. This implementation aims to provide a clear, educational, and efficient version of the Stable Diffusion architecture.

## 🌟 Features

- Pure PyTorch implementation of Stable Diffusion
- Clean and well-documented code
- Support for text-to-image generation
- Efficient implementation with modern PyTorch features
- Educational comments and explanations throughout the codebase

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 2.0 or higher
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stable_diffusion_in_pytorch.git
cd stable_diffusion_in_pytorch
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## 📖 Usage

To generate images using the model:

```python
from stable_diffusion import StableDiffusion

model = StableDiffusion()
image = model.generate(
    prompt="A beautiful sunset over mountains, digital art",
    num_inference_steps=50,
    guidance_scale=7.5
)
image.save("output.png")
```
